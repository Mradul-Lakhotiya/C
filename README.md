# C Code Repository

This repository contains my collection of C programming code, projects, and exercises. Whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced developer, feel free to explore, learn, and contribute.

## Repository Contents

- **[Folder 1 (itsthere/)](itsthere/):** This folder is named "itsthere" and its name is self-explanatory. It contains various C code files, and it was created either out of boredom or as a personal exploration to reinforce programming concepts.
- **[Folder 2 (Good/)](Good/):** This folder is named "Good," signifying that it contains code that I'm particularly proud of. It showcases my personal projects as well as instances where I received valuable assistance and collaboration from others.
